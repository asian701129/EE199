This first assignment was two steps:
1. Get a "Hello World" printout into the kernel log by creating a kernel module and loading it into the kernel.
2. Read the value from the TSC register and then print out that value into the kernel log.

This assignment has been completed, and the file hello.c accomplishes the tasks above.
